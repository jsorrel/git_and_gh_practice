One spring, I accompanied my mother on a road trip through the south to retrieve
 my little brother from a jazz music camp. We drove from Houston, Texas to
Louisville, Kentucky stopping for a relaxing stay in Hot Springs, Arkansas. The
weather was quite favorable and we enjoyed hiking in around the area. We
proceeded to Louisville and enjoyed the final performances at the closing
recital. Then we saw St. Louis and Branson, Missouri where we had a nice dinner
and saw some shows. My mom loved that stuff. Our last leg of the journey took us
to a public diamond mine and Arkansas state park. It was muddy. Turns out mining
is not very glamorous work, who knew?
